Using this tool is simple! 

Just download the **main.py** and **wiitdb.xml** and extract it anywhere you would like. Afterwards open your terminal in the directory the script is in and run

After extracting the files, the easiest way to get into the directory of the script is go into the address bar in your file explorer and type cmd. This will open the terminal in the current directory.
